# design-patterns

Study design patterns in GO.

- [singleton](./singleton/demo.go)

- [simple factory](./factory-simple/demo.go)

- [general factory](./factroy-general/demo.go) 
    `Method factory`

- [abstract factory](./factory-abstract/demo.go) 
    `abstract factory` is similar to `Method factory`. Differences in my view:
    - `Method factory` only can produce one kind of obj.
    - `Abstract factory` can produce couples of kind of objs.
